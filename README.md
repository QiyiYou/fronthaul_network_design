# Fronthaul Design for Wireless Networks: a Simulation Tool
This is the location of a simulator, developed using the MATLAB programming language, which has the following goals: (i) to determine which technology among Microwave Radio Transmission (MRT), Free Space Optics (FSO) and Fiber Optics (FO) applies best to connect two points, under user-specified conditions {Link Design Algorithm}; (ii) to optimally find a fronthaul topology for wireless networks — Baseband Unit (BBU) location and which technology should be used to connect to each Remote Radio Head (RRH) — involving a user-defined number of sites {Network Planning Algorithm}.

The associated algorithms, Link Design Algorithm and Network Planning Algorithm, can be found in the files 'link_design_algorithm.m' and 'network_planning_algorithm.m', respectively, within the 'Simulator' folder.

For more information, namely detailed descriptions of the aforementioned algorithms and some examples of results that can be obtained using the simulator, please refer to the 'Algorithms Details & Examples.pdf' file.
